My name is David Villavicencio, and I am currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, with minors in Entrepreneurship and Engineering. Originally from Ecuador, I take immense pride in my Andean culture as well as Colombian heritage on my motherâ€™s side.

As a first-generation immigrant, I have faced challenges in accessing education, healthcare, and job opportunities. These experiences fuel my commitment to leveraging technology to promote the development and empowerment of minority communities in the United States.

I am particularly passionate about robotics and AI integration, focusing on advancing human-technology interaction to create innovative solutions that bridge gaps and improve lives.
